# Foreign Language School Camp

Foreign Language School Camp is a MERN Stack single-page application that provides an online learning and teaching platform for users.

# Best Features
- This website helps you to find various foreign language courses to learn. You can see various foreign classes added by their instructors. This project has 3 dashboards based on Admin, Instructor & student.
- A student can see classes, and able to select any class. And he can show how many classes he adds to his dashboard. Also, he can enroll in selected classes by payment with the Stripe payment system.
- An Admin can access all users and he can change any user role like admin or instructor. Admin can manage all users & all add classes by the instructor. Admin can approve classes or decline classes.
- An Instructor is not able to add a class to the cart but he can able to add a new class. And he can review the class on his dashboard.
- In this project, I implement the Firebase authentication system & also implement an international payment system (Stripe). I am using React.js, Tanstack Query, Axios for security, Awesome React Components, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUi, for the front end, and MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js for the back end.
